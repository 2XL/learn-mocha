We all know someone like *Cowboy Coders*. (If you don't, its you!) 
The "*I get things done*" developer who maintains 
"*I don't have time to write tests*" or 
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" ... **Utter Nonsense**!

Its like building a house without a *foundation*! 

If you have ever worked (or *intend* to work) on a team of more than **one**
person, and *not* written tests, you might have the pain in recent memory. 

Is Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software
development woes? *Short answer*: **No**. 


#### What is Mocha?

Mocha is a **JavaScript test framework** running on **node.js** 
*and* the **browser**.
